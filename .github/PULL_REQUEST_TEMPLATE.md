### Have you:

- [ ] Run `brew audit --strict --online <formula>` (where `<formula>` is the name of the formula you're submitting) and corrected all errors?
- [ ] Built your formula locally prior to submission with `brew install <formula>`?

### New formula: have you

- [ ] Written a sensible test? (The best test is to compile and run a sample program.)

### Updates to existing formula: have you

- [ ] Checked that the tests still pass?
